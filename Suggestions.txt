# Details about the files

1. Data Files

    data/ Directory: Contains raw and processed datasets.
        train.csv, test.csv, validation.csv: Common file formats for storing structured data.
        images/: Directory for storing image files if working with image data.
    Source: Data files can come from various sources such as publicly available datasets, company databases, or data collected via web scraping.

2. Configuration Files

    config.yaml or config.json: Contains configuration parameters for the project, like hyperparameters, file paths, etc.
    Source: Written manually by the developer to maintain configuration settings in a centralized place.

3. Code Files

    main.py: The main script that ties all components together. It usually includes the training loop, evaluation, and inference code.
    data_loader.py: Handles data loading and preprocessing, including PyTorch DataLoader and custom dataset classes.
    model.py: Defines the neural network architecture using PyTorch nn.Module.
    train.py: Contains the training loop, including loss calculation, backpropagation, and optimizer steps.
    evaluate.py: Handles the evaluation of the model on validation/test data.
    predict.py: For running inference on new/unseen data.
    Source: Written by the developer to implement the machine learning model, data processing, and other tasks.

4. Utility Scripts

    utils.py: Contains utility functions that are used across different parts of the project, such as logging, metric calculations, or helper functions.
    Source: Written by the developer to avoid code duplication and enhance modularity.

5. Model Checkpoints

    checkpoints/ Directory: Stores model checkpoints, allowing for saving and loading model states.
        model_epoch_10.pth: Example of a PyTorch model checkpoint file.
    Source: Generated during the training process to save the state of the model at different stages.

6. Logs and Outputs

    logs/ Directory: Contains log files to track the training process, metrics, and other important information.
    outputs/ Directory: Stores results such as prediction outputs or processed files.
    Source: Generated by the project during execution to monitor and analyze performance.

7. Environment and Dependency Files

    requirements.txt: Lists all the Python packages and their versions required for the project.
    environment.yml: If using Conda, this file defines the environment setup.
    Source: Written manually by the developer to ensure reproducibility of the environment.

8. Documentation and Notes

    README.md: Provides an overview of the project, instructions on how to set it up, and how to run it.
    notebooks/ Directory: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA), experiments, and visualizations.
    Source: Written manually by the developer to provide documentation and insights into the project.

9. Testing Files

    tests/ Directory: Contains unit tests and integration tests to ensure code correctness.
        test_data_loader.py: Example of a test file for the data loader.
    Source: Written by the developer to maintain code quality and catch bugs early.
